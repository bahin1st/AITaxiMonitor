# AITaxiMonitor
This repository contains practical implementation of how to detect anomalies in driving. This repo not only covers the practical approach but it also can simulate , provide insights for dispachers, send API alerts. This  artwork is open sources to help Engineers, researchers find practical solutions using smart AI models.
